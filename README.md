## Introduction
This project involves using statistical techniques to analyze the Heart Disease UCI dataset. It includes data preprocessing, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval calculation to understand the differences in health factors between patients with and without heart disease.

## Dataset
The Heart Disease UCI dataset contains the following attributes:
- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Sex**: Sex of the patient
- **Cholesterol levels**: Cholesterol levels of the patient
- **Blood Pressure**: Blood pressure of the patient
- **Presence of heart disease**: Indicator of whether the patient has heart disease or not

The dataset can be found in the file `heart_cleveland_upload.csv`.

## Analysis
The Jupyter notebook `Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.ipynb` performs the following tasks:
- Loads and cleans the dataset.
- Calculates summary statistics for the dataset.
- Conducts hypothesis tests to determine significant differences in health factors.
- Calculates confidence intervals for mean differences in health factors.

## Installation
To get started with the Heart Disease UCI Dataset Analysis project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-uci-analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd heart-disease-uci-analysis
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
